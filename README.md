## Simplex Algorithm
Implementation of the Simplex method, used for large linear optimization problems with several variables.

## Use
The optimization problems are written in the ```pm21_pràctica_ASP1_dades.txt``` file. The problem selected is determined in the ```llegeix_dades.py``` file, where a student number (between 1 and 64) and a problem number (between 1 and 4) have to be chosen. These two values are defined by the variables ```numero_estudiant``` and ```numero_problema```, respectively.
